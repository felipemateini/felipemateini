Strongly oriented toward continuous learning, autonomy, and proactive problem-solving, with a career path marked by a successful transition into data and technical leadership in digital transformation and modernization initiatives.

Has contributed to high-impact projects at large organizations such as Petrobras and Bradesco, as well as consulting engagements in e-commerce and retail, consistently focused on generating business value through data.

Proficient in tools and technologies such as Power BI, Databricks, SQL, and Python (PySpark), with hands-on experience developing, migrating, and supporting data pipelines and dashboards in cloud environments, as well as maintaining robust analytical platforms like SAS and Apache Hive.
